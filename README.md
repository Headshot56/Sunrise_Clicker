# Sunrise_Clicker
A lightweight autoclicker program designed for minecraft java edition. You can set your own keybinds (mouse unfortunatly not included) and you can change the settings to whatever you like! Please feel free to give feedback on the quality. This is only a beta and will eventually go open source as a free alternative to the paid client ($5)
to install please click tags(2) under releases on the right side of github. Or simply install the files. There are 2 versions and you dont need both.
